            Air pollution is one of the major factors in deteriorating human health and also contributing to environmental degradation. According to World Health Organization around 7 million people around the globe die due to exposure of the fine particles contained in the air. It is estimated that around 35000 people die due to air pollution in Nepal annually.  Continuous exposure to Air Pollution can cause several diseases like strokes, Heart disease, Lung cancer and chronic Respiratory diseases. Particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10) can enter into our lungs and less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) can enter into our bloodstream. It is important and responsibility of every human being to maintain a good Air quality Index for better life and environmental aspects .Rapid urbanization and industrialization without proper measures to reduce air pollution has contributed a lot in air pollution. Recently developed countries are working towards reducing carbon emissions and developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. In context of Kathmandu Valley major places are continuously exposed to the higher concentration level of the particulate matters which is significantly affecting the health of the people. The major air pollution in Kathmandu city is caused due to emission from vehicles, dust particles, and burning fossil fuels. Though several awareness and activities are conducted to reduce the air pollution in Kathmandu city it still lacks far behind which requires a good framework and policies. This paper analyses the air quality index of the Kathmandu city in real-time and propose the model based on internet of Things (IoT) technology and recommendation to alleviate air pollution and improve air quality index.
